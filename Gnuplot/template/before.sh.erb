# When /home directory is nfs-mounted with lookupcache=none option,
# the error "/usr/bin/env: bad interpreter: Text file busy" occurs.
# This is because that the script.sh is not finished being copied in a compute node.
# To prevent that, change to a file with a different name in the compute node.
